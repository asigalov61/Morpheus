## Main Features:

### 1) Most advanced Music AI technology to-date (GPT3+RPR[RGA]) with FULL(!) attention
### 2) Multiple-embedding technology (proper MIDI encoding with binary velocity)
### 3) 5-in-1 capabilities: performance, continuation, melody, accompaniment, inpainting(!)
### 4) Multi-channel MIDI capabilities (9 simulataneous MIDI instruments + drums)
### 5) Distributed training capabilities (easily train on multiple GPUs out of the box)
### 6) Pure PyTorch implementation (you only need PyTorch for training and inference)
### 7) Super-optimized and streamlined code (easy to understand and to modify)
### 8) BONUS: CLaMP capabilities (CLIP for Music)

### FAQ

### Q) What is the idea behind Morpheus Maker 128x128?
### A) We basically want to try to squeze music into symmetrical space. In this case its [128, 128, 128, 128*10, 1]. Music generally loves symmetry. So do the transformer NNs. Its not the most perfect arrangement, nor it is the most universal, but it does show better results over assymetrical encoding schemas.
